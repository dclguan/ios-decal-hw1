//: ## Q1: Optionals
class Words {
    var wordA : String!
    var wordB : String!
    
    init (wordA: String?, wordB: String?) {
        self.wordA = wordA
        self.wordB = wordB
    }

//: ### Are the values passed in to the **init** function and those set to the instance
//: ### variables the same type? If not, why?


//: They aren't the same type - **!** variables are implicitly unwrapped optionals that are **nil** initially, but shouldn't be in the future. **?** variables are allowed to be **nil** and can be tested for.


//: ## Q2: Variable Types and Function Types
    static func arePalindromes(_ words: [String]) -> Bool {
        let reversedWords = words.map() {String($0.characters.reversed())}
        let numElements = words.count
        
        for i in 0 ..< numElements {
            if words[i] != reversedWords[i] {
                return false
            }
        }
        return true
    }
//: ### Why does the compiler dislike the **for loop**? Fix it.

//: ### change) the code at the very bottom. Debug the function.


//: Prior to Swift 3, since **let** is an immutable variable, `0 ..< numElements` would be an invalid way to represent a range and thus this for-loop would have been correctly represented in C-style as `for var i = 0; i < numElements; i++`. However, in Swift 3, C-style for-loops are no longer supported so the above is correct. This function arePalindromes is of type Bool, but will have no return value if all `words[i] == reversedWords[i]`: intuitively, if the for-loop completes we should `return true`. Lastly, this function should be a static function since it is not called on an instance of the class.


//: ## Q3: More Functions and Object Initialization
    func isAnagram() -> Bool {
        var countLetters = [Character : Int]() //Line X
        let lenA = self.wordA.characters.count
        let lenB = self.wordB.characters.count
        
        if lenA != lenB {
            return false
        }
        
        var arrA = Array(self.wordA.characters)
        var arrB = Array(self.wordB.characters)
        
        for i in 0...lenA-1 {
            let letter = arrA[i]
            if let val = countLetters[letter] { //Line Y
                countLetters[letter] = val + 1
            } else {
                countLetters[letter] = 1
            }
        }
        
        for i in 0...lenB-1 {
            let letter = arrB[i]
            if let val = countLetters[letter] {
                countLetters[letter] = val - 1
            } else {
                return false
            }
        }
        
        for (_, count) in countLetters {
            if count != 0 {
                return false
            }
        }
        
        return true
    }
//: ### What is the problem with declaring **countLetters** as we do in **Line X**,
//: ### and then using it in **Line Y**? Fix it (by only changing **Line X**).
//: ### What else is wrong with this function? You may have to refer to (but **not**
//: ### change) the code at the very bottom. Debug the function.


//: `countLetters : [Character : Int]` is an incorrect instantiation of an empty array. `return nil` should be `return true` as this function is **Bool** type. This function should not be a `class func`, since it is called on instances of the class and uses their instance variables. `lenA` and `lenB` should both be `let` variables since they're unchanged throughout the function. Finally in line 79, `(letter, count)` should be changed to `(_, count)` if `letter` is unused in the loop.
